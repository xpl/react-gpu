# react-gpu

A research project with the goal to explore the advantages of [React](https://reactjs.org/) component
model in describing rendering pipelines for modern GPUs (via [WebGPU](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/)).

- Integrates seamlessly with `react-dom`
- Exposes basic **WebGPU** concepts via [JSX tags](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) and [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
- Handles boring stuff like context management, resizing, animation loop, etc.
- Aims to provide easily composable blocks for building higher level graphics components.

_Currently in the very early stages of development, nothing to see here basically :) Subscribe!_
